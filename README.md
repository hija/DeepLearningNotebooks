# Machine Learning Notebooks

This repository contains some jupyter notebooks which I use to learn machine learning.

### Classifying Iris
The iris dataset is classified with a simple feed forward neural network and a SVM. Just a getting started example. I used scikit-learn for the SVM and Keras (with tensorflow as engine) for building the classifiers.

### Logistic Regression with numpy
This is a bit more interesting, since I implemented the logistic regression myself, so I did not use any library like scikit-learn or keras for the model generation. It uses backpropagation and the example is based on Andres Ng's course.

### Linear Regression
This is the linear regression model once implemented by scikit-learn and once by myself. Used to do a regression on the boston housing dataset. Furthermore, I used regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.

### Linear Discriminant Functions
This notebook implements two algorithms to generate linear discriminant functions. One iterative algorithm with gradient descend (Perceptron Algorithm) and one using the pseudoinverse. Furthermore, I added visualizations and examples, so I hope the concept gets clear.

## Unfinished

### KMeans Clustering
I started to implement KMeans Clustering, however, this is not finished - its missing the main loop. Helper functions are already defined.
